# Transfer Learning for Image Classification Using ImageNet

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to use transfer learning to perform image classification on a custom dataset by leveraging pre-trained models from ImageNet. ImageNet provides a large and diverse set of labeled images which are used to pre-train models. These models can be fine-tuned to classify images from a different dataset with potentially higher accuracy and less training time.

### Objective

To build a robust image classification model by applying transfer learning on a pre-trained ImageNet model. The custom dataset is used to fine-tune the model for specific classification tasks.

### Dataset

- **Custom Dataset**: Images organized into directories based on their classes. Includes training, validation, and test sets.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Models pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset are utilized, such as VGG16, ResNet50, or InceptionV3.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the custom dataset with images organized into directories.
- **`models/`**: Contains code for loading and adapting pre-trained ImageNet models.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **`src/`**: Source code for data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies required to run the code.
- **`README.md`**: This file.
